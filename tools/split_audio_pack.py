"""Cuts three long recordings into the 33 clips the demo page asks for.

Rendering 33 lines one at a time is 33 downloads and 33 renames. Instead paste
`preview/audio/lines-<role>.txt` into the speech engine in one go - the blank
lines between sentences become pauses - save the result as
`preview/audio/<role>.mp3`, and run this. It finds the pauses, cuts there, and
names each piece with the hash the page will look for.

    python tools/split_audio_pack.py                 # all three roles
    python tools/split_audio_pack.py narrator        # just one

Splitting on silence alone does not work: on a real ElevenLabs render the
pauses inside a sentence were 0.40-0.46 s and the pauses between lines
0.46-0.57 s, so no threshold separates them. Instead the audio is cut finely and
the pieces are grouped by how long each line ought to take, from its word count.
A line twice as long as its neighbour takes about twice as long to say, and that
places every boundary without having to classify a single gap.

    The test is narrow on purpose. Three broader attempts each repaired one line

    pause bonus in the cost function cut a clip to half a second, and snapping
    every boundary to its nearest biggest gap damaged the narrator. So a
    boundary only moves when all of this holds:

      - the biggest pause inside the group is clearly bigger than the one the
        boundary sits on, by at least 50 ms
      - it is exactly one piece earlier, not two
      - that piece is under a second, which is the length of an opening phrase
        rather than of anything a line ends with
      - and the group is not the last, whose boundary is the end of the file
